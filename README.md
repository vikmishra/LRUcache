# LRUcache
FIRST COMMIT
This GIT repository is an Implementation of LRU Cache

We will be specifying cache capacity during LRUCache object Creation. Once Cache Reaches it capacity, the end element will be pushed to the file Once the file reaches 10 MB, the file will be cleared.

Value for a given key will be first searched in hash map then in file. User of the LRU cache will be notified if the hit was in cache or file.
